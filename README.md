# Advanced techniques with TensorFlow - course notes

This repo contains my notes and coding projects from the advanced techniques with TensorFlow course.

The repo is split by course week.

## Initial setup
### Install the required NVIDIA software on Ubuntu
If using tensorflow for the first time then set up using the instructions here `https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu`

## 1. Custom models, layers and loss functions - custom.md
Week one focussed on customising tf keras.
